Dell EMC OpenManage Ansible Modules
*******************************************************************************

Dell EMC OpenManage Ansible Modules allows data center and IT administrators
to use RedHat Ansible to automate and orchestrate the configuration,
deployment, and update of Dell EMC PowerEdge Servers and modular infrastructure
by leveraging the management automation capabilities in-built into the
Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC), OpenManage Enterprise and
OpenManage Enterprise Modular.

OpenManage Ansible Modules simplifies and automates provisioning, deployment,
and updates of PowerEdge servers and modular infrastructure. It allows system
administrators and software developers to introduce the physical infrastructure
provisioning into their software provisioning stack, integrate with existing
DevOps pipelines and manage their infrastructure using version-controlled
playbooks, server configuration profiles, and templates in line with the
Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles.

Fixes
-----

* Issue 1(134624):
  Description: If an invalid job_id is provided,
  the idrac_lifecycle_controller_job_status_info module returns an error
  message with the description of the issue.

* Issue 2(188267):
  Description: No error message is displayed when the target iDRAC with
  firmware version less than 3.30.30.30 is updated.

*******************************************************************************
Known Issues
------------

* Issue 1(154815):
  Description: Firmware update may fail if multiple DUPs are uploaded.
  Local DUPs are stored in a temporary folder created by a scratch-pad.
  The capacity of this folder is only 300 MB.
  Resolution: Ensure that the combined size of all of the DUPs is less
  than 300 MB.

* Issue 2(155034):
  Description: If the controller does not support updating the
  EncryptionTypes parameter, a default value is automatically set during
  the storage volume create operation and the storage volume
  modify operation fails.

* Issue 3(155043):
  Description: Redfish Storage Volume operations sometime returns a operation
  progress percentage different than the actual job status.
  Resolution: It is recommended to wait for a few seconds to allow the job
  to reflect the actual status.

* Issue 4(186024):
  Description: ome_smart_fabric_uplink module does not allow the creation of
  multiple uplinks of the same name even though this is supported by OpenManage
  Enterprise Modular. If an uplink is created of the same name as an
  existing uplink, the existing uplink is modified.
  Resolution: It is recommended to use a unique name for each uplink.

*******************************************************************************
Limitations

  "dellemc_configure_idrac_users" module is not supported on modular servers.

* The "secure_boot_mode" parameter of the "dellemc_configure_bios module" is
