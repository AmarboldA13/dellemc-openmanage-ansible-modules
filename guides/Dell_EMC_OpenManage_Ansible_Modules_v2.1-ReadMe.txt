Dell EMC OpenManage Ansible Modules
*******************************************************************************

Dell EMC OpenManage Ansible Modules allows data center and IT administrators
to use RedHat Ansible to automate and orchestrate the configuration,
deployment, and update of Dell EMC PowerEdge Servers (12th generation of
PowerEdge servers and later) and modular infrastructure by leveraging the
management automation capabilities in-built into the Integrated Dell Remote
Access Controller(iDRAC) and OpenManage Enterprise (OME) respectively.

With the latest release of Dell EMC OpenManage Ansible Modules, the
capabilities have improved with support for OpenManage Enterprise. OpenManage
Ansible Modules simplifies and automates provisioning, deployment, and updates
of PowerEdge servers and modular infrastructure. It allows system
administrators and software developers to introduce the physical infrastructure
provisioning into their software provisioning stack, integrate with existing
DevOps pipelines and manage their infrastructure using version-controlled
playbooks, server configuration profiles, and templates in line with the
Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles.

Fixes
-----

* Issue 1(126402):
  Description: Creation of a template using the "ome_template" module may fail
  on OpenManage Enterprise version 3.1 if no template is created within 24
  hours (approximately) of its installation and setup.

  Workaround: A script is provided to fix the issue in OpenManage Enterprise
  3.1 through PSQN which creates a folder in CIFS share. See
  https://kb.dell.com/infocenter/index?page=content&id=SLN316882 for more
  details.

*******************************************************************************
Known Issues
------------

* Issue 1(154815):
  Description: Firmware update may fail if multiple DUPs are uploaded.
  Local DUPs are stored in a temporary folder created by a scratch-pad.
  The capacity of this folder is only 300MB.

* Issue 2(155034):
  Description: If the controller does not support updating the
  EncryptionTypes parameter, a default value is automatically set during
  the storage volume create operation and the storage volume
  modify operation fails.

* Issue 3(155043):
  Description: Redfish Storage Volume operations sometime returns a operation
  progress percentage different than the actual job status.


*******************************************************************************
Limitations
-----------
* "GracefulShutdown" choice of "change_power" option for
  "dellemc_change_power_state" module is supported only on iDRAC firmware
   versions 3.18.18.18 and above.

* "ipmiserialprivilege_users" option of "dellemc_configure_idrac_users"
   module is not supported for Modular servers.
