# Dell EMC OpenManage Ansible Modules for iDRAC (BETA)

## 1. Introduction

Dell EMC OpenManage Ansible Modules provide customers the ability to automate the Out-of-Band configuration management, deployment and updates for Dell EMC PowerEdge Servers using Ansible by leveraging the management automation built into the iDRAC with Lifecycle Controller. Using the iDRAC RESTful APIs based on DMTF's Redfish standard, OpenManage Ansible Modules enables data center and IT administrators to rapidly deploy their PowerEdge Server infrastructure, manage server configuration and orchestrate advanced tasks such as continuous deployment or firmware upgrade.

With OpenManage Ansible modules, you can do:
  * Server administration
  * Configure iDRAC's settings such as:
    * iDRAC Network Settings
    * SNMP and SNMP Alert Settings
    * Timezone and NTP Settings
    * System settings such as server topology
    * LC attributes such as CSIOR etc.
  * Perform User administration
  * BIOS and Boot Order configuration
  * RAID Configuration
  * OS Deployment
  * Firmware Updates

### 1.1 How OpenManage Ansible Modules work?

OpenManage Ansible modules uses the iDRAC Redfish RESTful API, so they must be run locally on the Ansible Controller.

OpenManage Ansible modules extensively uses the Server Configuration Profile (SCP) for most of the configuration management, deployment and update of PowerEdge Servers. Lifecycle Controller 2 version 1.4 and later adds support for SCP. A SCP contains all BIOS, iDRAC, Lifecycle Controller, Network amd Storage settings of a PowerEdge server and can be applied to multiple servers, enabling rapid, reliable and reproducible configuration.

A SCP operation can be performed using any of the following methods:
  * Export/Import SCP to/from a remote network share via CIFS, NFS
  * Export/Import SCP to/from a remote network share via HTTP, HTTPS (iDRAC firmware 3.00.00.00 and above)
  * Export/Import SCP to/from a local path by sending the content of the SCP file within the HTTP/S messages itself (supported on 14G PowerEdge Servers running iDRAC firmware version >=3.00.00.00 and on 12G/13G servers running iDRAC firmware version >= 2.50.50.50)

OpenManage Ansible Modules currently support import/export from a remote network share as well as from a local path. Since these modules are executed locally on the Ansible Controller, it is recommended to use the local path. However, if you want to use the network file share then please see the following section on setting up local mount point.

#### Setting up a local mount point for a remote network share

Since OpenManage Ansible modules extensively uses SCP to automate and orchestrate configuration, deployment and update on PowerEdge servers, you must locally mount the remote network share (CIFS or NFS) on the ansible server where you will be executing the playbook or modules. Local mount point also should have read-write privileges in order for OpenManage Ansible modules to write a SCP file to remote network share that will be imported by iDRAC.

You can use either of the following ways to setup a local mount point:

  * Use the ```mount``` command to mount a remote network share

    ```
    # Mount a remote CIFS network share on the local ansible machine.
    # In the below command, 192.168.10.10 is the IP address of the CIFS file
    # server (you can provide a hostname as well), Share is the directory that
    # is being shared, and /mnt/CIFS is the location to mount the file system
    # on the local ansible machine
    sudo mount -t cifs \\\\192.168.10.10\\Share -o username=user1,password=password,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0666 /mnt/CIFS

    # Mount a remote NFS network share on the local ansible machine.
    # In the below command, 192.168.10.10 is the IP address of the NFS file
    # server (you can provide a hostname as well), Share is the directory that
    # is being exported, and /mnt/NFS is the location to mount the file system
    # on the local ansible machine. Please note that NFS checks access
    # permissions against user ids (UIDs). For granting the read-write
    # privileges on the local mount point, the UID and GID of the user on your
    # local ansible machine needs to match the UID and GID of the owner of the
    # folder you are trying to access on the server. Other option for granting
    # the rw privileges would be to use all_squash option.

    sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.10.11:/Share /mnt/NFS -o rw,user,auto
    ```

  * Alternate and preferred way would be to use the ```/etc/fstab``` for mounting the remote network share. That way, you wonâ€™t have to mount the network share after a reboot and remember all the options.  General syntax for mounting the network share in ```/etc/fstab``` would be as follows:

    ```
    # Mounting a CIFS network share:
    //192.168.10.10/Share /mnt/CIFS cifs username=user,password=pwd,domain=domain_name,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0666,iocharset=utf8 0 0

    # Mounting a NFS network share:
    192.168.10.11:/Share /mnt/NFS nfs rw,user,auto 0 0
    ```
